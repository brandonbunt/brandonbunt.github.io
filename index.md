# Brandon Bunt

Currently pursuing a masters in mechanical engineering at the Cooper Union characterizing the thermal properties of mycelium as a novel insulation material. Internationally minded with deep interests in food, permaculture, decentralization and philosophy. 

## Current Projects

### [MUDBUG](mudbug.cooper.edu)
Developing IoT solutions for subsistence and family farmers with a focus on permaculture. MUDBUG stands for Multi-Use Data acquisition Bio Unit Group. 

### Recoop Project 
Recouping waste from projects at the Cooper Union's [AACE Lab](https://cooper.edu/academics/aace-lab). By creating a recycling network within the Cooper Union that will process waste PLA and PMMA from fabrication projects, a foundation will be set for eventually recycling all plastics on campus in the near future. 

### Soft Robotics Research with Professor Michelle Rosen
Designed and fabricated novel silicone tubes that actuate with pressure in early 2022. Currently working on finite element analysis using explicit solvers for the tubes to bolster a paper aiming to be published in 2023. 

## Work Experience

### Cooper Union Summer STEM: ["Next Gen Building Materials"](https://cooper.edu/engineering/courses/summer-stem/stem22-9)
January 2022 - August 2022

Designed a 3-week course that I taught twice for two groups of high school sophomores studying STEM over the summer. The course covered four key areas: mycology, the design cycle, circular economy, and acoustics. Students designed custom acoustic panels for specific locations within a local theater at the Loisaida Center. They then fabricated the molds at the Cooper Union, and grew their own mycelium panels in the lab. Installation of more panels made from the students’ designs will take place in the spring of 2023.  

### [AACE Lab](https://cooper.edu/academics/aace-lab) Student Technician
Student Technician responsible for servicing and fixing equipment, and aiding students on the projects they are working on. Projects include 3D-printing molds for silicone casting, designing enclosures for electronic projects, testing novel plastics, recycling failed 3D prints, and creating low-cost eye wear.

### [CUSAP](cusap.cooper.edu) / Lead
September 2020 - August 2022

Lead at the Cooper Union Sustainable Agriculture Project, working on small-scale modular sustainable agriculture design. Worked on aquaponic systems, investigating the symbiotic relationship between amano shrimp and kale suspended in a tank.
